**Vision**
1.  To develop a computational model for human lungs
2.  To simulate the human lungs of patients who are mechanically ventilated.
3.  To validate the model with the clinical data.

**Mission**
1.  Learn physiological functions of human lungs.
2.  Learn mathematical equations of tissue mechanics.
3.  Obtain clinical data from **_The University of Canterbury_**.
4.  Test with the model and validate.

**Success Criteria**
1.  The computational model gives physiological values after simulation.
2.  The model output matches with patient's clinical data.

**Team Agreement**
1.  Update the progress weekly.
2.  Request for a meeting with supervisor if any issue arises.
3.  Clearly describe what each code is doing by providing comments.
4.  Get feedback from supervisors regarding the performance of the model.

**Project Team**
1.  Supervisor
    1.  Provide necessary guideline and feedback.
2.  Student
    1.  Read literatures and learn the physiological processess and computaional model.
    2.  Submit the progress back to supervisor and get feedback.
