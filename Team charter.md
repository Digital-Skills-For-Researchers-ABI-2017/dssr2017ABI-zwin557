**_Vision_**
1.  To validate the model with the clinical data.

**_Mission_**
1.  Obtain clinical data from the University of Canterbury.
2.  Process the clinical data to be used in the model.
3.  Use the processed data as an input to the model.
4.  Test with the model and validate by optimising parameters.

**_Success Criteria_**
