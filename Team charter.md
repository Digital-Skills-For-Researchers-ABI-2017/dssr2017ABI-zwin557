**_Vision_**
1.  To develop a computational model for human lungs
2.  To simulate the human lungs of patients who are mechanically ventilated.
3.  To validate the model with the clinical data.

**_Mission_**
1.  Learn physiological functions of human lungs.
2.  Learn mathematical equations of tissue mechanics.
3.  Obtain clinical data from The University of Canterbury.
4.  Test with the model and validate.

**_Success Criteria_**
1.  The computational model gives physiological values after simulation.
2.  The model output matches with patient's clinical data.

**_Team Agreement_**
1.  Update the progress weekly.
2.  Request for a meeting with supervisor if any issue arises.
3.  Clearly describe what each code is doing by providing comments.
4.  Get feedback from supervisors regarding the performance of the model.
5.  Collaborate with other team members.

**_Project Team_**
1.  Supervisor
    1.  Provide necessary guideline and feedback.
2.  Student
    1.  Read literatures and learn the physiological processess and computaional model.
    2.  Submit the progress back to supervisor and get feedback.
    3.  Collaborate with other students.
