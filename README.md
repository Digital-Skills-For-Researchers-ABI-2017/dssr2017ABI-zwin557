**Synopsis**
To develop a computational model which can simulate the response of human lungs to **invasive mechanical ventilation** in hospitals. This project will lead to development of clinical software which can help clinicians decide the optimal management for mechanically ventilated patients.

**Code Example**

```ruby
Paw = RawQaw + V/C - Ppl
where subscript aw represents airway, P is the pressure from the mechanical ventilation machine, R is the resistance, Q is the airflow, V is the alveolar volume, C is the alveolar compliance and Ppl is the pleural pressure.
```
The left-hand side of equation and Qaw from right-hand side of equation are inputs to the model from the machine. The rest of the right-hand side equations will be optimised.

**Motivation**

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

**Installation**

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.
API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

**Tests**

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

**Contributors**

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

**License**

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
